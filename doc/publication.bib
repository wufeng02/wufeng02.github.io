  abstract = {This paper reports the project of a shopping mall service robot, named KeJia, which is designed for customer guidance, providing information and entertainments in a real shopping mall environment. The background, motivations, and requirements of this project are analyzed and presented, which guide the development of the robot system. To develop the robot system, new techniques and improvements of existing methods for mapping, localization, and navigation are proposed to address the challenge of robot motion in a very large, complex, and crowded environment. Moreover, a novel multimodal interaction mechanism is designed by which customers can conveniently interact with the robot either in speech or via a mobile application. The KeJia robot was deployed in a large modern shopping mall with the size of 30,000 m2 and more than 160 shops; field trials were conducted for 40 days where about 530 customers were served. The results of both simulated experiments and field tests confirm the feasibility, stability, and safety of the robot system.},

Given open-ended high-level user instructions in natural language, robots need to generate a plan, i.e., a sequence of low-level executable actions, to complete the required tasks. To address this, we exploit the knowledge on semantic roles of common verbs defined in semantic dictionaries such as FrameNet and integrate it with Answer Set Programming --- a task planning framework with both representation language and solvers. In the experiments, we evaluated our approach using common benchmarks on service tasks and showed that it can successfully handle much more tasks than the state-of-the-art solution. Notably, we deployed the proposed planning system on our service robot for the annual RoboCup@Home competitions and achieved very encouraging results.},

In this case, a robot is given a verbal description about a person whom the robot is required to recognize. This task is challenging since humans and robots have significantly mismatched perceptual capabilities (e.g., recognizing the color of a coat). Without assuming that all linguistic descriptions and perceptual data are correct, we use a probabilistic model to ground the target person. In particular, the acceptability of color descriptions is modeled based on visual similarity and the confusion matrix of the color classifier which make the system more robust to illumination. Two groups of experiments were conducted. Our experimental results demonstrate that our system is robust to both perception and description errors.},

Interactional arrangements define the extent to which control is distributed between the collaborative parties. We provide two field trials, one to study an "on-the-loop" arrangement in which HQ monitors and intervenes in agent instructions to field players on demand, and the other to study a version that places headquarters more tightly "in-the-loop". The studies provide and understanding of the sociotechnical collaboration between players and the agent in these interactional arrangements, by conducting interaction analysis of video recordings and game log data. The first field trial focuses on the collaboration of field responders with the planning agent. Findings highlight how players negotiate the agent guidance within the social interaction of the collocated teams. The second field trial focuses on the collaboration between the automated planning agent and the headquarters. We find that the human coordinator and the agent can successfully work together in most cases, with human coordinators inspecting and 'correcting' the agent-proposed plans. Through this field trial-driven development process, we generalise interaction design implications of automated planning agents around the themes of supporting common ground and mixed-initiative planning.},

  abstract = {Major natural or man-made disasters such as Hurricane Katrina or the 9/11 terror attacks pose significant challenges for emergency responders. First, they have to develop an understanding of the unfolding event either using their own resources or through third-parties such as the local population and agencies. Second, based on the information gathered, they need to deploy their teams in a flexible manner, ensuring that each team performs tasks in the most effective way. Third, given the dynamic nature of a disaster space, and the uncertainties involved in performing rescue missions, information about the disaster space and the actors within it needs to be managed to ensure that responders are always acting on up-to-date and trusted information. Against this background, this paper proposes a novel disaster response system called HAC-ER. Thus HAC-ER interweaves humans and agents, both robotic and software, in social relationships that augment their individual and collective capabilities. To design HAC-ER, we involved end-users including both experts and volunteers in a several participatory design workshops, lab studies, and field trials of increasingly advanced prototypes of individual components of HAC-ER as well as the overall system. This process generated a number of new quantitative and qualitative results but also raised a number of new research questions. HAC-ER thus demonstrates how such Human-Agent Collectives (HACs) can address key challenges in disaster response. Specifically, we show how HAC-ER utilises crowdsourcing combined with machine learning to obtain most important situational awareness from large streams of reports posted by members of the public and trusted organisations. We then show how this information can inform human-agent teams in coordinating multi-UAV deployments, as well as task planning for responders on the ground. Finally, HAC-ER incorporates an infrastructure and the associated intelligence for tracking and utilising the provenance of information shared across the entire system to ensure its accountability. We individually validate each of these elements of HAC-ER and show how they perform against standard (non-HAC) baselines and also elaborate on the evaluation of the overall system.},

To capture the uncertainty and partial observability of the domain, we model this problem as a POMDP.

By exploiting the problem structure we propose a novel online planning algorithm to solve this model. Specifically, we generate plans for the responders based on Monte-Carlo simulations and compute actions for the UAVs according to the value of information. Our empirical results confirm that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art both in time and solution quality.},

  abstract = {Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a rich framework for planning under uncertainty. However, exactly solving a large MDP is usually intractable due to the ''curse of dimensionality'' - the state space grows exponentially with the number of state variables. Online algorithms tackle this problem by avoiding computing a policy for the entire state space. On the other hand, since online algorithm has to find a near-optimal action online in almost real time, the computation time is often very limited. In the context of reinforcement learning, MAXQ is a value function decomposition method that exploits the underlying structure of the original MDP and decomposes it into a combination of smaller subproblems arranged over a task hierarchy. In this article, we present MAXQ-OP --- a novel online planning algorithm for large MDPs that utilizes MAXQ hierarchical decomposition in online settings. Compared to traditional online planning algorithms, MAXQ-OP is able to reach much more deeper states in the search tree with relatively less computation time by exploiting MAXQ hierarchical decomposition online. We empirically evaluate our algorithm in the standard Taxi domain --- a common benchmark for MDPs --- to show the effectiveness of our approach. We have also conducted a long-term case study in a highly complex simulated soccer domain and developed a team named WrightEagle that has won five world champions and five runners-up in the recent 10 years of RoboCup Soccer Simulation 2D annual competitions. The results in the RoboCup domain confirm the scalability of MAXQ-OP to very large domains.},

To address this challenge, we formulate the single-agent patrolling problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) 	and propose a computationally efficient algorithm to solve this model. Building upon this, to compute patrols for multiple agents, the single-agent algorithm is extended for each agent with the aim of maximising its marginal contribution to the team.

  abstract = {In the aftermath of major disasters, first responders are typically overwhelmed with large numbers of, spatially distributed, search and rescue tasks, each with their own requirements. Moreover, responders have to operate in highly uncertain and dynamic environments where new tasks may appear and hazards may be spreading across the disaster space. Hence, rescue missions may need to be re-planned as new information comes in, tasks are completed, or new hazards are discovered. Finding an optimal allocation of resources to complete all the tasks is a major computational challenge. In this paper, we use decision theoretic techniques to solve the task allocation problem posed by emergency response planning and then deploy our solution as part of an agent-based planning tool in real-world field trials. By so doing, we are able to study the interactional issues that arise when humans are guided by an agent. Specifically, we develop an algorithm, based on a Multi-Agent Markov Decision Process representation of the task allocation problem and show that it outperforms standard baseline solutions. We then integrate the algorithm into a planning agent that responds to requests for tasks from participants in a mixed-reality location-based game, called AtomicOrchid, that simulates disaster response settings in the real-world. We then run a number of trials of our planning agent and compare it against a purely human driven system. Our analysis of these trials show that human commanders adapt to the planning agent by taking on a more supervisory role and that, by providing humans with the flexibility of requesting plans from the agent, allows them to perform more tasks more efficiently than using purely human interactions to allocate tasks. We also discuss how such flexibility could lead to poor performance if left unchecked.},

One of the key challenges is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To address this, we introduce a novel online planning algorithm for large POMDPs using Thompson sampling based MCTS that balances between cumulative and simple regrets. The proposed algorithm Dirichlet-Dirichlet-Normal Gamma based Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning (D2NG-POMCP) 	treats the accumulated reward of performing an action from a belief state in the MCTS search tree as a random variable following an unknown distribution with hidden parameters.

Motivated by task allocation in disaster response, we extend standard DCOP models to consider uncertain task rewards where the outcome of completing a task depends onits current state, which is randomly drawn from unknown distributions. The goal of solving this problem is to find a solution for all agents that minimizes the overall worst-case loss. This is a challenging problem for centralized algorithms because the search space grows exponentially with the number of agents and is nontrivial for existing algorithms for standard DCOPs. To address this, we propose a novel decentralized algorithm that incorporates Max-Sum with iterative constraint generation to solve the problem by passing messages among agents. By so doing, our approach scales well and can solve instances of the task allocation problem with hundreds of agents and tasks.},

  abstract = {Planning under uncertainty is one of the fundamental challenges in Artificial Intelligence. Decision theory offers a mathematical framework for optimizing decisions in these domains. In recent years, researchers have made rapid progresses for decision making in single-agent cases. This enables relatively large problems to be solved by state-of-the-art MDP or POMDP algorithms. However, the research of decentralized decision making is still in its infancy and existing solutions can only solve very small "toy" problems. As a nature extension of Markov decision theory to multi-agent systems, the DEC-POMDP model has very high computational complexity, namely NEXP-hard. This is not surprising given that agents in multi-agent settings not only have to keep tracking on the state transition of the environment but also the potential behaviors of the other agents. As a result, the joint policy space can be huge. Hence how to search over the large joint policy space and find the best one is a key challenge when solving a large DEC-POMDP. Due to the problem complexity, exact algorithms can solve merely tiny problems. Therefore, my thesis work focuses on developing effect algorithms for solving general DEC-POMDPs approximately. Generally, planning in multi-agent systems can work either in online or offline fashions. This thesis contributes to the literature by proposing both online and offline algorithms. Furthermore,
a model-free algorithm is presented for planning when the exact model is not available.},

We present a new algorithm, Point-Based Policy Generation, which avoids altogether searching the entire joint policy space.

A lot of effort has been made to solve this problem with additional assumptions on the communication abilities of agents. However, in some realworld applications, communication is limited and the assumptions are rarely satisfied. An alternative approach newly developed is to employ a correlation device to correlate the agents' behavior without exchanging information during execution. In this paper, we apply correlation device to large-scale and spare-reward domains. As a basis we use the framework of infinite-horizon DEC-POMDPs which represent policies as joint stochastic finite-state controllers. To solve any problem of this kind, a correlation device is firstly calculated by solving Correlation Markov Decision Processes (Correlation-MDPs) and then used to improve the local controller for each agent. By using this method, we are able to achieve a tradeoff between computational complexity and the quality of the approximation. In addition, we demonstrate that, adversarial problems can be solved by encoding the information of opponents'ddate behavior in the correlation device.We have successfully implemented the proposed method into our 2D simulated robot soccer team and the performance in RoboCup-2006 was encouraging.},

One of the fundamental challenges is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To address this problem, we propose to balance between exploration and exploitation via posterior sampling in the contexts of Markov decision process (MDP) and partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Specifically, we treat the cumulative reward returned by taking an action from a search node in the MCTS search tree as a random variable following an unknown distribution. We parametrize this distribution by introducing necessary hidden parameters, and infer the posterior distribution of the hidden parameters in a Bayesian way. We further expand a node in the search tree by using Thompson sampling to select an action based on its posterior probability of being optimal. Following this idea, we develop Dirichlet-NormalGamma based Monte Carlo tree search (DNG-MCTS) and Dirichlet-Dirichlet-NormalGamma based partially observable Monte Carlo planning (D2NG-POMCP) algorithms respectively for Monte Carlo planning in MDPs and POMDPs. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art with better values on several benchmark problems.},

In this paper, using motion capture system, we propose a reliable calibration framework that enables the precise estimation of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of RGB-D sensors and provide a model-free depth calibration method based on heteroscedastic Gaussian Processes.

Recent efforts that applied Multi-Agent RL (MARL) to this problem have shown remarkable improvement over centralized RL, with the scalability to solve large problems by distributing the global control to local RL agents. Unfortunately, it is also easy to get stuck in local optima because each agent only has partial observability of the environment with limited communication. To tackle this, we borrow ideas from feudal RL and propose a novel MARL approach combining with the feudal hierarchy. Specifically, we split the traffic network into several regions, where each region is controlled by a manager agent and the agents who control the traffic signals are its workers. In our method, managers coordinate their high-level behaviors and set goals for their workers in the region, while each lower-level worker controls traffic signals to fulfill the managerial goals. By doing so, we are able to coordinate globally while retain scalability. We empirically evaluate our method both in a synthetic traffic grid and real-world traffic network using the SUMO simulator. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in almost all evaluation metrics commonly used for traffic signal control.},

  abstract  = {Reward shaping is an effective technique for incorporating domain knowledge into reinforcement learning (RL). Existing approaches such as potential-based reward shaping normally make full use of a given shaping reward function. However, since the transformation of human knowledge into numeric reward values is often imperfect due to reasons such as human cognitive bias, completely utilizing the shaping reward function may fail to improve the performance of RL algorithms. In this paper, we consider the problem of adaptively utilizing a given shaping reward function. We formulate the utilization of shaping rewards as a bi-level optimization problem, where the lower level is to optimize policy using the shaping rewards and the upper level is to optimize a parameterized shaping weight function for true reward maximization. We formally derive the gradient of the expected true reward with respect to the shaping weight function parameters and accordingly propose three learning algorithms based on different assumptions. Experiments in sparse-reward cartpole and MuJoCo environments show that our algorithms can fully exploit beneficial shaping rewards, and meanwhile ignore unbeneficial shaping rewards or even transform them into beneficial ones.},

the Markov assumption that governs most single-agent RL methods and is one of
the key challenges in multi-agent RL. To tackle this, we propose to train multiple
policies for each agent and postpone the selection of the best policy at execution
time. Specifically, we model the environment non-stationarity with a finite
set of scenarios and train policies fitting each scenario. In addition to multiple
policies, each agent also learns a policy predictor to determine which policy is
the best with its local information. By doing so, each agent is able to adapt its
policy when the environment changes and consequentially the other agents alter
their policies during execution.We empirically evaluated our method on a variety
of common benchmark problems proposed for multi-agent deep RL in the literature.
Our experimental results show that the agents trained by our algorithm have
better adaptiveness in changing environments and outperform the state-of-the-art

Offline meta-reinforcement learning provides an effective way to quickly adapt to a new task by using replay datasets of multiple tasks for offline policy learning. Applying offline meta-reinforcement learning to complex tasks will face two challenges. Firstly, reinforcement learning algorithms overestimate the value of state-action pairs not contained in the dataset and thus select non-optimal actions, resulting in poor performance. Secondly, meta-reinforcement learning algorithms need not only to learn the policy but also to have robust and efficient task inference capabilities. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an offline meta-reinfor-cement learning algorithm based on contrastive prediction. To cope with the problem of overestimation of value functions, the proposed algorithm uses behavior cloning to encourage policy to prefer actions included in the dataset. To improve the task inference capability of meta-learning, the proposed algorithm uses recurrent neural networks for task inference on the contextual trajectories of the agents and uses contrastive learning and prediction networks to analyze and distinguish potential structures in different task trajectories. Experimental results show that the agents trained by the proposed algorithm can score more than 25 percentage points when faced with unseen tasks, and it has higher meta-training efficiency and better generalization performance compared with existing methods.},

Detecting humans from laser data is an important functionality for the safety of navigation in the shared workspace with people. Nevertheless, traditional methods normally utilize machine learning techniques on hand-crafted geometrical features extracted from individual clusters. Moreover, the datasets used to train the models are usually small and need to manually label every laser scan, increasing the difficulty and cost of deploying people detection algorithms in new environments. To tackle these problems, (1) we propose a novel deep learningbased
method, which uses the deep neural network in a sliding window fashion to effectively classify every single point of a laser scan. (2) To increase the speed of inference without losing performance, we use a jump distance clustering method to decrease the number of points needed to be evaluated. (3) To reduce the workload of labeling data, we also propose an approach to automatically annotate datasets collected in real scenarios. In general, the proposed approach runs in real-time and performs much better than traditional methods. Secondly, conventional pure reactive obstacle avoidance algorithms can produce inefficient and oscillatory behaviors in dynamic environments, making pedestrians confused and possibly leading to dangerous reactions. To improve the legibility and
naturalness of obstacle avoidance in human crowded environments, we introduce a sampling-based local path planner, similar to the method used in autonomous driving cars. The key idea is to avoid obstacles by switching lanes. We also adopt a simple rule to decrease the number of unnecessary deviations from the reference path. Experiments carried out in real-world environments confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Aiming at such scenarios, this paper proposed a new and convenient global localization system based on man-made landmark. The system localized based on multiple man-made landmarks attached on the unshaded ceiling, and could achieve stable pose estimation with only one camera. The whole system consisted of two main processes: map construction and global localization, according to their specific functions. During the map construction, it automatically estimated the pose of the man-made landmark in the global coordinate system, according to the camera's observation of the landmark and the pose estimation output by some laser SLAM algorithm. Given this, it then established the map of environment based on the pose of each landmark. During the global localization, it estimated the robot's pose in real time based on the camera's observation of the man-made landmarks in the map with known poses, combined with the pre-integrated information fused with the odometer and IMU. Sufficient experiments show that the localization error of the system is stable within 10 cm when running in the deployed environment, and the system can also ensure real-time pose output, which meets the application requirements of typical indoor mobile robot global localization.},

To acquire solutions with high confidence, it is necessary to enable robots to explore the solution space automatically based on performance feedback.

The main advan-tage of our framework is that it does not only generate facial expressions automatically but can also be customized according to user preferences. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework can efficiently generate realistic facial expressions without hard coding or prior knowledge of the robot kinematics.

To address this, we use reward machines (RM) to encode human knowledge about the task and refine datasets for offline RL.

Then, we further use the labeled datasets to generate refined datasets, which is smaller but better for offline RL. By using the RM, we can decompose a long-horizon task into easier sub-tasks, inform the agent about their current stage along task completion, and guide the offline learning process. In addition, we generate counterfactual experiences by RM to guide agent to complete each sub-task.

To encourage global coordination, previous work partitions the traffic network into several regions and learns policies for agents in a feudal structure. However, static network partition fails to adapt to dynamic traffic flow, which changes frequently over time. To address this, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning approach with adaptive network partition. Specifically, we partition the network into several regions according to the dynamic traffic flow over time. To do this, we propose two approaches: one is directly to use graphic neural network (GNN) to generate the network partition, and the other is to use Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) to find the best partition with criteria computed by GNN. Then, we design a variant of Qmix using GNN to handle various dimensions of input, given by the dynamic network partition. Finally, we use a feudal hierarchy to manage agents in each partition and promote global cooperation. By doing so, agents are able to adapt to the traffic flow as required in practice. We empirically evaluate our method both in a synthetic traffic grid and real-world traffic networks of three cities, widely used in the literature. The experimental results confirm that our method achieved better performance both in a synthetic traffic grid and real-world traffic networks of three cities, in terms of average travel time and queue length, than several leading TSC baselines.},

However, it is still hard to succeed in long-horizon tasks especially when given suboptimal and multimodal offline datasets. Nevertheless, existing RL methods rarely consider the structured information in offline datasets, which are commonly found in many robotic tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel offline RL approach that combines the techniques of dataset augmentation and subtask relabeling. Specifically, we first extract the subtasks and build the task graph based on the structured information in offline datasets. We then use the task graph to sample and generate an augmented dataset, which is more suitable for offline RL learning. After that, we relabel the dataset according to the task graph and finally learn a subtask-conditioned policy to complete the task. By doing so, we decompose the task of reaching a long-horizon goal state into a sequence of easier subtasks. This is not only useful for handling the long-horizon problem, but also reduces the error introduced by the offline dataset. We conducted extensive experiments in both the D4RL benchmark dataset and real-world robot with complex manipulation tasks.

While existing interactive segmentation methods excel in handling simple targets, they encounter challenges in obtaining high-quality masks from some complex scenes, even with a large number of clicks. Also, the cost of retraining the model from scratch for special scenarios is unacceptably high. To address these issues, we propose ClickAdapter, a simple yet powerful interactive segmentation model adapter without the need for no pre-training. Through introducing a small number of additional parameters and computations, the adapter module effectively enhanced the ability of interactive segmentation models to obtain high-quality prediction with limited clicks. Specifically, we incorporate a detail extractor that aims to extract spatial correlations and local detail features of images. These fine-grained data are then integrated into a model with our adapter to generate segmentation masks with sharp and precise edges. During the training process, only the parameters of our adapter are learnable, thereby reducing the training cost. Features in special scenarios can also be infused more efficiently. To verify the efficiency and performance advantages of the proposed method, a series of experiments on a wide range of benchmarks were conducted, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm achieved cutting-edge performance compared to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},
