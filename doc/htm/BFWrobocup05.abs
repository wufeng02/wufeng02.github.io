This paper introduces the implementation of Wright Eagle 2-D Simulation team 2005. The team is implemented on the basis of WrightEagle 2004 and thus inherits the decision-making framework of its antecedent, which is a combination of a simplified model of MDP and PRS system. In WrightEagle2005, we re-build several key basic-action modules of the team in order to enhance the performance of the agent, such as the Unknown-player Matching algorithm, the new Fast-Dribble skill and the fixed Pass-Ball algorithm, and we also use a new decision-making structure which is based on POMDP method to implement the tactic behavior.
