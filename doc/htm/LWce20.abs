Multi-Agent Path Planning(MAPP) is the problem of finding an optimal path set for multiple agents from their starting position to the target position without any collisions.Research on this problem has abundant application scenarios in the fields of logistics,military and security.This paper systematically sorts out and classifies the recent research progress in MAPP both at home and abroad.According to the differences in the optimality of results,the MAPP algorithms are classified into optimal group and approximate group.The optimal MAPP algorithms are mainly divided into four categories,which are based on A* search,cost growth tree,conflict based search and protocol respectively.The approximate MAPP algorithms are mainly divided into two categories:the unbounded suboptimal algorithm and the bounded suboptimal algorithm.Based on the classification mentioned above,this paper analyzes the characteristics of each algorithm,introduces the representative researches in recent years and discusses the future research directions of MAPP problem.
