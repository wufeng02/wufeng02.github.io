Nowadays there are a lot of kinds of cleaning robots which producted by different manufacturers come into people's lives. But it is still a problem that how to evaluate each robot's performance to check whether the quality is acceptable. In this paper, we make the first trial to evaluate the complete coverage path planning algorithm which is the core algorithm of a cleaning robot with Mocap system, and three simple metrics were proposed to evaluate overall performance of the algorithm. Lastly, the comparisons between different kinds of robots are presented.
