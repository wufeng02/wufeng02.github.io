Calibration is important to service robot, but the process of calibration is time consuming and laborious. With the popularity of service robot, an automatic and universal calibration system is urgent to be developed, therefore we propose a general batch-calibration framework, Motion Capture System is adopt as an external measurement device in virtual of it can provide realtime, accurate movement data of measured objects. We will show that the system is effective and promising with a case study of odometry calibration.
