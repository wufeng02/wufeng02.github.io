In this paper, we present the system design and the key techniques of our mobile robot platform called KeJia-LC, who won the first place in the demo challenge on Benchmarkinng Service Robots in RoboCup 2015. Given the fact that KeJia-LC is a low-cost version of our KeJia robot without shoulder and arm, several new technical demands comparing to RoboCup@Home are highlighted for better understanding of our system. With the elaborate design of hardware and the reasonable selection of sensors, our robot platform has the features of low cost, wide generality and good extensibility. Moreover, we integrate several functional softwares (such as 2D&3D mapping, localization and navigation) following the competition rules, which are critical to the performance of our robot. The effectiveness and robustness of our robot system has been proven in the competition.
