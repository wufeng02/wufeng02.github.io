The background, motivations, and requirements of this project are analyzed and presented, which guide the development of the robot system. To develop the robot system, new techniques and improvements of existing methods for mapping, localization, and navigation are proposed to address the challenge of robot motion in a very large, complex, and crowded environment. Moreover, a novel multimodal interaction mechanism is designed by which customers can conveniently interact with the robot either in speech or via a mobile application. The KeJia robot was deployed in a large modern shopping mall with the size of 30,000 m2 and more than 160 shops; field trials were conducted for 40 days where about 530 customers were served. The results of both simulated experiments and field tests confirm the feasibility, stability, and safety of the robot system., 2.2MB","tags":"publication","title":"Robots serve humans in public places - KeJia robot as a shopping assistant"},{"url":"//wufeng02.github.io/publication.html#LZWijcai17","text":"10.24963/ijcai.2017/609, Integrating Answer Set Programming with Semantic Dictionaries for Robot Task Planning, inproceedings, In this paper, we propose a novel integrated task planning system for service robots in domestic domains.

To address this, we exploit the knowledge on semantic roles of common verbs defined in semantic dictionaries such as FrameNet and integrate it with Answer Set Programming — a task planning framework with both representation language and solvers. In the experiments, we evaluated our approach using common benchmarks on service tasks and showed that it can successfully handle much more tasks than the state-of-the-art solution.

Interactional arrangements to support team coordination with a planning agent, In this paper we present the study of interactional arrangements that support the collaboration of headquarters (HQ), field responders and a computational planning agent in a time-critical task setting created by a mixed-reality game. Interactional arrangements define the extent to which control is distributed between the collaborative parties. We provide two field trials, one to study an “on-the-loop” arrangement in which HQ monitors and intervenes in agent instructions to field players on demand, and the other to study a version that places headquarters more tightly “in-the-loop”. The studies provide and understanding of the sociotechnical collaboration between players and the agent in these interactional arrangements, by conducting interaction analysis of video recordings and game log data. The first field trial focuses on the collaboration of field responders with the planning agent. Findings highlight how players negotiate the agent guidance within the social interaction of the collocated teams. The second field trial focuses on the collaboration between the automated planning agent and the headquarters. We find that the human coordinator and the agent can successfully work together in most cases, with human coordinators inspecting and ‘correcting’ the agent-proposed plans. Through this field trial-driven development process, we generalise interaction design implications of automated planning agents around the themes of supporting common ground and mixed-initiative planning., article, @article{FGJccpe16,\n author = {Joel E.

First, they have to develop an understanding of the unfolding event either using their own resources or through third-parties such as the local population and agencies. Second, based on the information gathered, they need to deploy their teams in a flexible manner, ensuring that each team performs tasks in the most effective way. Third, given the dynamic nature of a disaster space, and the uncertainties involved in performing rescue missions, information about the disaster space and the actors within it needs to be managed to ensure that responders are always acting on up-to-date and trusted information. Against this background, this paper proposes a novel disaster response system called HAC-ER. Thus HAC-ER interweaves humans and agents, both robotic and software, in social relationships that augment their individual and collective capabilities. To design HAC-ER, we involved end-users including both experts and volunteers in a several participatory design workshops, lab studies, and field trials of increasingly advanced prototypes of individual components of HAC-ER as well as the overall system. This process generated a number of new quantitative and qualitative results but also raised a number of new research questions. HAC-ER thus demonstrates how such Human-Agent Collectives (HACs) can address key challenges in disaster response. Specifically, we show how HAC-ER utilises crowdsourcing combined with machine learning to obtain most important situational awareness from large streams of reports posted by members of the public and trusted organisations. We then show how this information can inform human-agent teams in coordinating multi-UAV deployments, as well as task planning for responders on the ground. Finally, HAC-ER incorporates an infrastructure and the associated intelligence for tracking and utilising the provenance of information shared across the entire system to ensure its accountability. We individually validate each of these elements of HAC-ER and show how they perform against standard (non-HAC) baselines and also elaborate on the evaluation of the overall system., 1.3MB","tags":"publication","title":"A Disaster Response System based on Human-Agent Collectives"},{"url":"//wufeng02.github.io/publication.html#WRCijcai16","text":"Feng Wu and Sarvapali D.

To capture the uncertainty and partial observability of the domain, we model this problem as a POMDP. However, the resulting model is computationally intractable and cannot be solved by most existing POMDP solvers due to the large state and action spaces. By exploiting the problem structure we propose a novel online planning algorithm to solve this model.

However, exactly solving a large MDP is usually intractable due to the ''curse of dimensionality'' - the state space grows exponentially with the number of state variables. Online algorithms tackle this problem by avoiding computing a policy for the entire state space. On the other hand, since online algorithm has to find a near-optimal action online in almost real time, the computation time is often very limited. In the context of reinforcement learning, MAXQ is a value function decomposition method that exploits the underlying structure of the original MDP and decomposes it into a combination of smaller subproblems arranged over a task hierarchy. In this article, we present MAXQ-OP—a novel online planning algorithm for large MDPs that utilizes MAXQ hierarchical decomposition in online settings. Compared to traditional online planning algorithms, MAXQ-OP is able to reach much more deeper states in the search tree with relatively less computation time by exploiting MAXQ hierarchical decomposition online. We empirically evaluate our algorithm in the standard Taxi domain—a common benchmark for MDPs—to show the effectiveness of our approach. We have also conducted a long-term case study in a highly complex simulated soccer domain and developed a team named WrightEagle that has won five world champions and five runners-up in the recent 10 years of RoboCup Soccer Simulation 2D annual competitions.

Hence, we develop a set of multi-UAV supervisory control interfaces and a multi-agent coordination algorithm to support human decision making in this setting. To elucidate the resulting interactional issues, we compare manual and mixed-initiative task allocation in both static and dynamic environments in lab studies with 40 participants and observe that our mixed-initiative system results in lower workloads and better performance in re-planning tasks than one which only involves manual task allocation. Our analysis points to new insights into the way humans appropriate flexible autonomy., Buenos Aires, Argentina, July, @inproceedings{RFIijcai15,\n address = {Buenos Aires, Argentina},\n author = {Sarvapali D.

In particular, HAC-ER utilises crowdsourcing combined with machine learning to extract situational awareness information from large streams of reports posted by members of the public and trusted organisations. We then show how this information can inform human-agent teams in coordinating multi-UAV deployments as well as task planning for responders on the ground. Finally, HAC-ER incorporates a tool for tracking and analysing the provenance of information shared across the entire system.

Moreover, responders have to operate in highly uncertain and dynamic environments where new tasks may appear and hazards may be spreading across the disaster space. Hence, rescue missions may need to be re-planned as new information comes in, tasks are completed, or new hazards are discovered. Finding an optimal allocation of resources to complete all the tasks is a major computational challenge. In this paper, we use decision theoretic techniques to solve the task allocation problem posed by emergency response planning and then deploy our solution as part of an agent-based planning tool in real-world field trials. By so doing, we are able to study the interactional issues that arise when humans are guided by an agent. Specifically, we develop an algorithm, based on a Multi-Agent Markov Decision Process representation of the task allocation problem and show that it outperforms standard baseline solutions. We then integrate the algorithm into a planning agent that responds to requests for tasks from participants in a mixed-reality location-based game, called AtomicOrchid, that simulates disaster response settings in the real-world. We then run a number of trials of our planning agent and compare it against a purely human driven system. Our analysis of these trials show that human commanders adapt to the planning agent by taking on a more supervisory role and that, by providing humans with the flexibility of requesting plans from the agent, allows them to perform more tasks more efficiently than using purely human interactions to allocate tasks. We also discuss how such flexibility could lead to poor performance if left unchecked., 5.3MB","tags":"publication","title":"Human-Agent Collaboration for Disaster Response"},{"url":"//wufeng02.github.io/publication.html#WRJijcai15","text":"Agile Planning for Real-World Disaster Response, inproceedings, We consider a setting where an agent-based planner instructs teams of human emergency responders to perform tasks in the real world.

The goal of solving this problem is to find a solution for all agents that minimizes the overall worst-case loss. This is a challenging problem for centralized algorithms because the search space grows exponentially with the number of agents and is nontrivial for existing algorithms for standard DCOPs.

Decision theory offers a mathematical framework for optimizing decisions in these domains. In recent years, researchers have made rapid progresses for decision making in single-agent cases. This enables relatively large problems to be solved by state-of-the-art MDP or POMDP algorithms. However, the research of decentralized decision making is still in its infancy and existing solutions can only solve very small “toy” problems. As a nature extension of Markov decision theory to multi-agent systems, the DEC-POMDP model has very high computational complexity, namely NEXP-hard. This is not surprising given that agents in multi-agent settings not only have to keep tracking on the state transition of the environment but also the potential behaviors of the other agents. As a result, the joint policy space can be huge. Hence how to search over the large joint policy space and find the best one is a key challenge when solving a large DEC-POMDP. Due to the problem complexity, exact algorithms can solve merely tiny problems. Therefore, my thesis work focuses on developing effect algorithms for solving general DEC-POMDPs approximately. Generally, planning in multi-agent systems can work either in online or offline fashions. This thesis contributes to the literature by proposing both online and offline algorithms.

The algorithm helps overcome the high computational complexity of solving such problems offline. The key challenges in decentralized operation are to maintain coordinated behavior with little or no communication and, when communication is allowed, to optimize value with minimal communication. The algorithm addresses these challenges by generating identical conditional plans based on common knowledge and communicating only when history inconsistency is detected, allowing communication to be postponed when necessary. To be suitable for online operation, the algorithm computes good local policies using a new and fast local search method implemented using linear programming. Moreover, it bounds the amount of memory used at each step and can be applied to problems with arbitrary horizons. The experimental results confirm that the algorithm can solve problems that are too large for the best existing offline planning algorithms and it outperforms the best online method, producing much higher value with much less communication in most cases. The algorithm also proves to be effective when the communication channel is imperfect (periodically unavailable).

These approaches allow agents to focus their computations on regions of the environment they encounter during the trials, leading to significant computational savings. We present a novel trial-based dynamic programming (TBDP) algorithm for DEC-POMDPs that extends these benefits to multi-agent settings. The algorithm uses trial-based methods for both belief generation and policy evaluation. Policy improvement is implemented efficiently using linear programming and a sub-policy reuse technique that helps bound the amount of memory. The results show that TBDP can produce significant value improvements and is much faster than the best existing planning algorithms., Atlanta, United States, inproceedings, @inproceedings{WZCaaai10,\n address = {Atlanta, United States},\n author = {Feng Wu and Shlomo Zilberstein and Xiaoping Chen},\n booktitle = {Proceedings of the 24th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)},\n pages = {908-914},\n title = {Trial-Based Dynamic Programming for Multi-Agent Planning},\n year = {2010}\n}\n\n, 2010, doc/pdf/WZCaaai10.pdf, WZCaaai10, Proceedings of the 24th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 908-914, 246.2KB","tags":"publication","title":"Trial-Based Dynamic Programming for Multi-Agent Planning"},{"url":"//wufeng02.github.io/publication.html#WZCicaps09","text":"Feng Wu and Shlomo Zilberstein and Xiaoping Chen, Multi-Agent Online Planning with Communication, We propose an online algorithm for planning under uncertainty in multi-agent settings modeled as DEC-POMDPs. The algorithm helps overcome the high computational complexity of solving such problems off-line. The key challenge is to produce coordinated behavior using little or no communication. When communication is allowed but constrained, the challenge is to produce high value with minimal communication. The algorithm addresses these challenges by communicating only when history inconsistency is detected, allowing communication to be postponed if necessary. Moreover, it bounds the memory usage at each step and can be applied to problems with arbitrary horizons. The experimental results confirm that the algorithm can solve problems that are too large for the best existing off-line planning algorithms and it outperforms the best online method, producing higher value with much less communication in most cases., Thessaloniki, Greece, inproceedings, @inproceedings{WZCicaps09,\n address = {Thessaloniki, Greece},\n author = {Feng Wu and Shlomo Zilberstein and Xiaoping Chen},\n booktitle = {Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS)},\n pages = {321-329},\n title = {Multi-Agent Online Planning with Communication},\n year = {2009}\n}\n\n, 2009, doc/pdf/WZCicaps09.pdf, WZCicaps09, Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS), 321-329, 201.3KB","tags":"publication","title":"Multi-Agent Online Planning with Communication"},{"url":"//wufeng02.github.io/publication.html#WCrobocup07","text":"10.1007/978-3-540-68847-1_18, Feng Wu and Xiaoping Chen, Solving Large-Scale and Sparse-Reward DEC-POMDPs with Correlation-MDPs, inproceedings, Within a group of cooperating agents the decision making of an individual agent depends on the actions of the other agents. A lot of effort has been made to solve this problem with additional assumptions on the communication abilities of agents. However, in some realworld applications, communication is limited and the assumptions are rarely satisfied. An alternative approach newly developed is to employ a correlation device to correlate the agents' behavior without exchanging information during execution. In this paper, we apply correlation device to large-scale and spare-reward domains. As a basis we use the framework of infinite-horizon DEC-POMDPs which represent policies as joint stochastic finite-state controllers. To solve any problem of this kind, a correlation device is firstly calculated by solving Correlation Markov Decision Processes (Correlation-MDPs) and then used to improve the local controller for each agent. By using this method, we are able to achieve a tradeoff between computational complexity and the quality of the approximation. In addition, we demonstrate that, adversarial problems can be solved by encoding the information of opponents'ddate behavior in the correlation device.We have successfully implemented the proposed method into our 2D simulated robot soccer team and the performance in RoboCup-2006 was encouraging., Atlanta, United States, 208-219, @inproceedings{WCrobocup07,\n address = {Atlanta, United States},\n author = {Feng Wu and Xiaoping Chen},\n booktitle = {Proceedings of the Robot Soccer World Cup XI Symposium (RoboCup)},\n doi = {10.1007/978-3-540-68847-1_18},\n pages = {208-219},\n title = {Solving Large-Scale and Sparse-Reward {DEC-POMDPs} with Correlation-{MDPs}},\n year = {2007}\n}\n\n, 2007, doc/pdf/WCrobocup07.pdf, WCrobocup07, Proceedings of the Robot Soccer World Cup XI Symposium (RoboCup), 219.5KB","tags":"publication","title":"Solving Large-Scale and Sparse-Reward DEC-POMDPs with Correlation-MDPs"},{"url":"//wufeng02.github.io/publication.html#BFWrobocup05","text":"Peng Bai and Changjie Fan and Feng Wu and Xiaoping Chen, WrightEagle 2D Simulation Team 2005, inproceedings, This paper introduces the implementation of Wright Eagle 2-D Simulation team 2005.
